          Protocol (such as the creation of a Lens Profile, posting or commenting on User Content on-chain, mirroring
          and collecting publications) are created as immutable entities on the blockchain, therefore the history of

          notice shall have thirty (30) days to respond to the notice. Within sixty (60) days after the aggrieved party
          sent the initial notice, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith by videoconference, or by telephone,

          may submit the Dispute to arbitration as set forth below.
